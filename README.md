# Access Labs Pizza

![Pizza Screen Recording](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/react/pizza.gif)

Welcome to your first day at the Access Labs Pizzeria!
Today, you are tasked to building an online menu of all the pizzas that the pizzeria offers.


This application is done using a local database;
for the code that uses a josn-server under `http://localhost:3000/pizzas`, check this repository : `https://github.com/lizbur10/React-Pizza.git`

```

After firing up your server, render the list of pizzas in to the table.

Each row in the table should be a pizza component and when you click the "Edit" button, it should send the pizza associated with that component into the Pizza form.

The pizza form will then render the information about the pizza in the form, which will be editable.

When the form is submitted, the information should be reflected in your table and persist in the backend.

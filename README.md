# Access Labs Pizza

![Pizza Screen Recording](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/react/pizza.gif)

Building an online menu of all the pizzas that the pizzeria offers.


This application is done using a local database;
for the code that uses a josn-server [Here] (https://github.com/lizbur10/React-Pizza.git)

```

The app renders a list of pizzas in to the table.

Each row in the table is a pizza component and when you click the "Edit" button, it sends the pizza associated with that component into the Pizza form.

The pizza form will then render the information about the pizza in the form, which will be editable.

When the form is submitted, the information is reflected in the table and persist in the backend.

```
